0.5| short release cycles | 0.5 | Evidence in [Releases](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/releases) and [Code Frequency](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/graphs/code-frequency) Short Release cycles were achieved by completing smaller features one at a time instead of a single large feature release. |
0.5| workload is spread over the whole team (so one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others| 0.5 | Evidence in [issue history](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) & [Contributors](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/graphs/contributors). To provide an even workload between the team, each team member was assign a large feature to implement and support other tasks as needed.|
0.5| Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|0.5| Evidence in [Readme](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/blob/main/README.md)|
0.5| 	the files CONTRIBUTING .md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|0.5|Evidence in [Contributing](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)|
0.5| Docs: doco generated , format not ugly| 0.5 | Evidence [Source Code](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/tree/main/src) and Use of Sphinx for documentation generation.|
0.5| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|0.5|Evidence in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/blob/main/requirements.txt). The whole team has configured their system using the requirements.txt file.|
0.5| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base |0.5| Evidence in [Commit History](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/graphs/commit-activity)|
1|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)| 1 | Function description is included in the code for every function with proper docstring mentioning the function objective, input parameters and return parameters. [Function description](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/blob/main/docs/function_description.md). Individual descriptions can also be found throughout the [source code](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/tree/main/src) with detail descriptions per function/method. |
0.5|Number of commits: by different people |0.5| Evidence in [Commit History](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/graphs/commit-activity)|
1|issues are being closed|1|Evidence in [Closed Issues](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) & [Project-Slash Phase 3](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/projects/1)|
0.5| issues are discussed before they are closed |0.5| Evidence in [issue history](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed). Issues are discussed in Discord channel prior to being closed and merged. Summaries are provided for the main features.| 
0.5|Use of syntax checkers.|0.5| Pylint Implementation to check syntax. Evidence in [pylint](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/actions/workflows/pylint.yml)|

0.5|	Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code. | 0.5 | Evidence in [readme.md](https://github.com/TommasU/slash/blob/main/README.md)|
