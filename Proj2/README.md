**<u>Part 3</u>**

We are a team of four individuals in the course Masters in Computer Science (MCS). This essay is a part of Project1 assignment under the course “Software Engineering”. This essay talks about the project we chose out of the five options offered to us and the challenges we faced while running it. It also briefly touches upon the experiences with other projects. All in all, it talks about the learnings we got throughout the course of Project 1.<br><br>
We chose the project Slash (https://github.com/TommasU/slash). Slash is a tool that scrapes the most popular e-commerce websites to get the best deals on searched items across these websites. The main problem was related to the Flask module. Despite downloading it through pip as mentioned in the documentation, it always showed that the Flask is not installed properly. To solve this problem, we uninstalled Flask and reinstalled it by running the command prompt as administrator. Then when we ran “Flask –version”, it still showed that Flask is not installed. Then we realized that the machine is not recognizing that Flask is already installed. So, we added the path of the Flask in our environment variables.<br><br>
Still the application could not run. So, we realized that the problem is now due to the inconsistency in version. So, we uninstalled Flask and installed the Flask version which is used in the app and again added it to the environment variables. Then we could run the app properly.<br><br>
All the other versions of the app, that is, the full version and the mini version, which are the command line versions ran smoothly and we were quite impressed by it.<br><br>
This app could have been easier to install if the deprecated dependencies, like Flask, were updated timely in the project as well as documentation. Another possible enhancement that could be done and we are planning to do is to containerize the application through Docker. By making a Docker image, the user will be able to replicate the project quite easily without the hassle of installing Python or any kind of dependencies, including the operating system.<br><br>
Now talking about the other projects, we were not able to run the teacher’s pet bot since one of the libraries, that is, discord-components is deprecated and hence we were not able to install it properly. Even the other libraries like discord.py, which is also one of the required dependencies, had many changes. So, we decided to pivot to another project.<br><br>
With simplii we were able to somehow run the project by managing the dependency versions but we were getting a 500 error possibly due to a routing issue. Moreover, we did not find it as extensible as Slash.<br><br>
We had trouble with Wolf track plus as we could not get the reply from the person with the AWS IAM credentials and hence couldn't run the project. We tried contacting the person with the credentials and also tried replicating the database, but we still had trouble with connecting to the database.<br><br>
With Wolftrack 3.0 as well we could not get the AWS credentials but thankfully, they had containerized the application. We were able to build the image but we faced issues while running it. Our guess is that when we were tagging the image, we did not have one of the images since we received an error which said that image was not available. Moreover, we found that the project was quite well built and found lesser scope than Slash regarding extensibility and improvements.<br><br>
So, at the end, we decided that the project Slash would be our best bet and we were quite impressed by it. We are planning to add more sorting options in the UI version and plan to connect the application to Google Cloud and automate the script which can update a Google Sheet so that we can get timely updates of the prices. Moreover, we plan to containerize the application and update the dependencies according to their current latest versions.<br><br>
We plan to eliminate the issues we had especially during the installation of the program and aim to make this application even better during our Project 2.<br><br>
